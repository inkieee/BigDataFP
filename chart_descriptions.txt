AQI Variation over Time for each Territory/State
    X-axis (Date by Month):

    This axis represents time, specifically broken down by month. Each data point on the X-axis will represent a specific month (e.g., January, February, etc.).

    Y-axis (AQI):

        This axis represents the Air Quality Index (AQI). The scale on the Y-axis will likely range from low AQI values (indicating good air quality) to high AQI values (indicating poor air quality).

    Series of State Name:

        This refers to multiple lines or areas on the chart, each representing data for a specific state. The legend will associate line colors or patterns with individual state names, allowing you to compare AQI trends across different states.

    Overall Visualization:

    The chart will display stacked area regions, where each area represents the AQI for a particular state over time. By looking at the chart, you can see how AQI varies by month for each state. Here are some insights you might glean from this visualization:

        Seasonal variations: You might observe if AQI values tend to be higher or lower in certain months for specific states.
        State comparisons: You can compare AQI trends between states to see if some states consistently have higher or lower AQI values throughout the year.
        Outliers: The chart might reveal months with unusually high or low AQI values for a particular state.

    Additional Considerations:

        The chart might use transparency for the area fills to allow better visualization of overlapping areas when multiple states have similar AQI values.
        You might have additional features like tooltips that display specific AQI values for a state when hovering over a data point on the chart.

    Overall, a discrete area chart with this configuration is a valuable tool for analyzing and comparing AQI data across different states and months, providing insights into potential seasonal variations and state-specific air quality trends.
